# SITE ELECTIONS2017.FR

At EEMI, 2017, 3rd year of bachelor's degree :

This is a website we had to do during my workshop week.
We were a team of three, and we shared the work thanks to branch. Here is only the master one.

The topic was to create a website were a french citizen may be able to vote online for the next presidential elections.
From an admin side, two type of administrators should have been able to 
- Manage the different type of administrators ;
- Manage the citizen ;
- Manage the current and ulteriors rounds (up to 2) ;
- Manage the candidates profile ;
- Manage the display of the results ;

Each of us had to do an equal numbers of tasks, and we had to know / understand what the others have done.
